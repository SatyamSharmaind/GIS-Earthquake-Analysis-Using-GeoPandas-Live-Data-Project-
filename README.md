# GIS Earthquake Analysis Using GeoPandas (Live Data Project)
## Project Overview
### This project analyzes live earthquake data using geospatial techniques. The data was retrieved from the USGS (United States Geological Survey) live GeoJSON API. The objective was to perform spatial, ### temporal, and country-level analysis using Python GIS libraries.
## Key Steps Performed
### 1 Fetched live earthquake GeoJSON data from USGS API. 
### 2 Filtered earthquakes with magnitude greater than 4. 
### 3 Extracted time-based features (hour analysis). 
### 4 Performed spatial join with Natural Earth country boundaries. 
### 5 Counted earthquakes per country. 
## Libraries Used
### 1 GeoPandas – For spatial data handling and spatial joins. 
### 2 Pandas – For data manipulation and aggregation. 
### 3 Matplotlib – For plotting and visualization. 
### 4 Requests – For fetching live data from API.
## Analysis Performed
### 1 Magnitude-based filtering and categorization. 
### 2 Country-level spatial aggregation (Point-in-Polygon analysis). 
### 3 Temporal analysis (Earthquake frequency by hour). 
### 4 Top affected countries identification. 

## Conclusion
### This project demonstrates practical GIS skills including spatial joins, coordinate reference system handling, live API data integration, and geospatial visualization. It reflects real-world GIS internship-level capabilities.
